  title: Brahmavihārās
  def: "Brahma Vihara meditation, also known as the Four Immeasurables, involves cultivating four qualities: loving-kindness (metta), compassion (karuna), empathetic joy (mudita), and equanimity (upekkha). It aims to develop a state of unconditional love, compassion towards suffering, joy in the happiness of others, and a balanced mind in all situations."

- term: dmn
  title: DMN
  def: "The default mode network (DMN) is a system of connected brain areas that show increased activity when a person is not focused on what is happening around them. such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering. It can also be active when the individual is thinking about others or themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future."

  title: EEG
  def: An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a recording of brain activity. During this painless test, small sensors are attached to the scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced by the brain.

- term: flanker_test
  title: Flanker Test
  def: "The flanker test is a cognitive task used to measure interference control—the ability to focus attention on relevant stimuli while suppressing responses to irrelevant distractions. Participants respond to a central target stimulus surrounded by distracting 'flanker' stimuli. Performance on this task reflects the efficiency of controlled and automatic attentional processes."

  title: fMRI
  def: An fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) measures changes in blood flow related to neural activity in the brain, offering insights into brain function and activity patterns.

- term: gamma
  title: Gamma
  def: "Gamma brain waves are a type of brainwave pattern that oscillate at approximately 25 to 100 Hz. Gamma waves are associated with states of heightened perception, problem-solving, and consciousness. Gamma waves play a crucial role in cognitive functioning, including memory, and information processing, and are thought to integrate thoughts and information from different parts of the brain."

- term: inflammation
  title: Inflammation
  def: "Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system to injury, infection, or stress, characterized by the release of signaling molecules called cytokines. Chronic inflammation is linked to impaired cognitive function, increased risk of disease, and accelerated aging."

- term: jhana
  title: Jhana
  def: "Jhana refers to states of deep concentration or meditative absorption in Buddhist practice, achieved through intense focus and mindfulness. These states represent progressive levels of mental and emotional calm, clarity, and bliss, cultivated through the practice of meditation, leading to profound insight and enlightenment."

- term: mbsr
  title: MBSR
  def: "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a program designed to help individuals cope with stress, pain, and illness. Developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the 1970s, it combines meditation and yoga to promote awareness and stress management. The eight-week program teaches participants to focus on the present moment non-judgmentally, enhancing their ability to manage difficulties."

- term: randomized_controlled_trial
  title: Randomized Controlled Trial
  def: A Randomized Controlled Trial is a scientific study design that randomly assigns participants to either an experimental group receiving an intervention or a control group, allowing researchers to measure the true effect of the intervention while minimizing bias.

- term: telomeres
  title: Telomeres
  def: "Telomeres are protective caps at the end of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. Telomere length is associated with aging and health, with longer telomeres linked to better health and longevity. Stress and lifestyle factors can affect telomere length, making them a potential marker of health and aging."

- term: depersonalization
  title: Depersonalization
  def: "Depersonalization is a dissociative experience characterized by feelings of detachment from one's self, body, or mental processes. Individuals experiencing depersonalization may feel like an outside observer of their thoughts, feelings, or body, or they may feel as if they're in a dream. It can occur as a temporary response to stress, as a symptom of psychiatric disorders, or as a feature of certain meditation experiences."

- term: mind_wandering
  title: Mind Wandering
  def: "Mind wandering is the spontaneous shift of attention away from a current task or external environment to internally generated thoughts, memories, or fantasies. This common cognitive process is associated with default mode network activation and has been extensively studied in relation to meditation practices, which often aim to reduce mind wandering."

- term: mindfulness
  title: Mindfulness
  def: "Mindfulness is the psychological process of purposely bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment without judgment. It involves maintaining awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment with an attitude of curiosity and acceptance. In meditation contexts, mindfulness practices typically involve focusing attention on the breath or body sensations as anchors to the present moment while acknowledging and releasing distracting thoughts."

- term: beta
  title: Beta
  def: "Beta brain waves are a type of brainwave pattern that oscillate between approximately 12 to 30 Hz. Beta waves are typically associated with active thinking, focus, alertness, and engagement with the external world. They are prominent during conscious, goal-directed activity and are linked to cognitive tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, and sustained attention."

- term: telomerase
  title: Telomerase
  def: "Telomerase is an enzyme that helps maintain telomere length by adding repetitive DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes. It plays a crucial role in cellular aging and longevity, as it can counteract the natural shortening of telomeres that occurs with cell division. This enzyme is particularly active in stem cells, germline cells, and cancer cells, while its activity is typically low in most mature somatic cells, contributing to cellular senescence and aging."

- term: effect_size
  title: Effect Size
  def: "Effect size is a statistical concept that quantifies the magnitude or strength of a relationship, difference, or intervention outcome. Unlike p-values which only indicate statistical significance, effect sizes measure how meaningful a result is in practical terms. Common measures include Cohen's d (standardized mean difference), correlation coefficients (r), and odds ratios. In meditation research, effect sizes help quantify the practical impact of different meditation practices on psychological or physiological outcomes."
