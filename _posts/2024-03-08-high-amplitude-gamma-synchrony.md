meta_description: "EEG study reveals experienced Buddhist monks generate extraordinary gamma brain waves during loving-kindness meditation. These high-amplitude oscillations, linked to attention and perception, correlate with meditation experience and persist outside formal practice."
snippet: "This study compares the brain wave activity of a group of seasoned meditators to that of meditation novices, both at rest and during meditation. It finds that experienced meditators generate extremely high amounts of gamma brain waves, associated with enhanced perception, consciouness, attention and memory.  These gamma waves are elevated both in- and out- side of meditation. More meditation experience is correlated with stronger gamma waves."

## Background Information

This study investigated the impact of long-term meditation practice on the brain, focusing on experienced Buddhist practitioners compared to novice volunteers. The researchers used electroencephalogram ({% include definition.html term="eeg" %}) recordings to measure brain activity in two groups: one consisting of long-term Buddhist meditators with thousands of hours of meditation experience, and another group of student volunteers with no prior meditation experience but who received a week of meditation training for the study.

The researchers found significant differences in the brain activity in the two groups, focusing specifically on {% include definition.html term="gamma" %}-waves, which are fast brain waves associated with higher cognitive and emotional processes. The study found that the experienced meditators produced extremely high levels of gamma brain wave activity during meditation, which is suggestive that they have developed an enhanced capacity for concentration, emotional control, and a heightened state of awareness compared to people with less meditation experience.

## What They Did

THe study included two groups of participants. The first group included eight Buddhist practitioners with 15 to 40 years of experience in meditation, amounting to between 10,000 to 50,000 hours of practice. The second group consisted of 10 healthy student volunteers who were meditation novices.  Before the meditation sessions began, the researchers recorded a baseline EEG from each participant. This involved having the participants rest with both eyes open and closed in random order to measure their natural brain activity without meditation.

Each participant then engaged in meditation on the {% include definition.html term="brahmaviharas" %}, focusing on generating a state of "unconditional loving-kindness and compassion." This type of meditation does not focus on specific objects, memories, or images but aims to pervade the mind with benevolence and compassion. The novice group received instructions and practiced this meditation for an hour daily for a week before the EEG recordings.

EEG data were captured before, during, and after the meditation sessions, with particular attention to gamma-band oscillations, which are fast brain waves associated with higher cognitive and emotional processes.  This figure shows measurements of gamma brain waves in a single meditator during a single meditation session.

## One Big Result

Experienced meditators in the tradition of unbounded metta meditation can produce high levels of gamma brain wave activity during meditation, which suggests they have developed an enhanced capacity for concentration, emotional control, and a heightened state of awareness compared to people with less meditation experience.

> We found robust gamma-band oscillation and long-distance phase-synchrony during the generation of the nonreferential compassion meditative state.

To put what this means into some context, gamma waves are associated with several aspects of cognition, perception and emotion, including:

* **Enhanced Perception**: Gamma waves are thought to be involved in the processing of sensory information, contributing to heightened awareness and perception of the environment.
* **Consciousness**: They have been linked to states of conscious awareness, integrating different streams of thought and sensory information into a cohesive experience of reality.
* **Attention and Focus**: High levels of gamma activity are associated with intense focus and concentration, helping the brain to process and react to information more effectively.
* **Learning and Memory**: Gamma waves play a crucial role in the encoding of memory and the learning process, facilitating the synaptic plasticity necessary for these functions.

The maps use color coding (blue to red) to show the percentage of participants in each group who exhibited at least double (2x) gamma wave amplitude during meditation compared to rest. The experienced meditators' map shows much more red and yellow areas, indicating that nearly all experienced practitioners showed significant gamma wave increases across multiple brain regions.](/assets/article_images/high-amplitude-gamma-synchrony/gamma_map.png)

Interestingly, the researchers found that the experienced meditators showed levels of Gamma waves that have only previously been reported under abnormal conditions, such as during epileptic seizures or in patients with brain tumors.

> The high-amplitude gamma activity found in some of these practitioners are, to our knowledge, the highest reported in the literature in a nonpathological contex

This result is indicative that the conscious experience of meditators is foundationally different from that of non-meditators.

## Miscellaneous Interesting Takeaways

### Meditation Changes Your Brain at Rest

The paper also covered scans of the subject's brains while they were *not* meditating, and here there was a second striking result.

> In addition to the meditation-induced effects, we found a difference in the normative EEG spectral profile between the two populations during the resting state before meditation. It is not unexpected that such differences would be detected during a resting baseline, because the goal of meditation practice is to transform the baseline state and to diminish the distinction between formal meditation practice and everyday life

It appears clear that a long-term meditation practice changes the brain even when the meditator is not actively meditating such that the brain is more likely to be in a state of heightened awareness and emotional control.  THe size of this effect was correlated stringly with the number of hours of meditation that the meditators had performed, with more meditation leading to stronger gamma waves at rest

Each dot represents one meditator, with experience ranging from approximately 10,000 to 50,000 hours. The plot shows a strong positive correlation (r=0.69), demonstrating that more experienced meditators maintain higher gamma wave activity even when not actively meditating.](/assets/article_images/high-amplitude-gamma-synchrony/gamma_vs_experience.png)

### Full-brain Coordination

Synchrony is the coordination of brain activity across different regions.  Synchrony occurs when brain waves in widely different parts of the brain fire together.  The researchers found that the experienced meditators showed a greater increase in synchrony patterns during meditation than the novice meditators.

> The size of synchrony patterns increased more for the long-time practitioners than for the controls from neutral to meditation states. These data suggest that large-scale brain coordination increases during mental practice

### Different Types of Meditation Are, Well, Different

This study used meditators who were bracticing boundless metta meditation.  Most studies (for example, [Hagerty et al, 2013](/ecstatic-meditation-reward-system), also summarized on this site) use mditation from concentration traditions.

The authors note that the results of this study are completely incompatible with the results of those other studies, which find primarily increases in alpha and theta brain waves.

> These concentration techniques can be seen as a particular form of top-down control that may exhibit an important slow oscillatory component. First-person descriptions of objectless meditations, however, differ radically from those of concentration meditation. Objectless meditation does not directly attend to a specific object but rather cultivates a state of being

This particular result indicates that there are likely a large variety of altered states achievable through meditation, and that different techniques will have different effects on the brain.

More recent research by [Maher et al. (2025)]({% post_url 2025-05-14-neurological-substrates-of-meditation %}) extends these findings by localizing increased gamma activity to specific brain regions including the amygdala and hippocampus during loving-kindness meditation, even in novice practitioners. In contrast to the high-amplitude gamma synchrony observed here during non-referential compassion, [Hagerty et al. (2013)]({% post_url 2024-03-05-ecstatic-meditation-reward-system %}) found that jhana meditation produces different patterns of neural activity, emphasizing increased activation in reward networks and decreased activity in self-referential processing areas.
