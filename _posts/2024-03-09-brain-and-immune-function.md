meta_description: "Research by Davidson and Kabat-Zinn shows 8-week MBSR meditation course enhances immune function and positive brain activity. Novice meditators developed stronger flu vaccine response and increased left-sided anterior brain activation."
snippet: "This study takes a group of untrained meditators and puts them through an 8-week course in Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  The study finds that the meditation group have brain activity implying a more positive emotional frame.  Furthermore, the meditation group had a significantly stronger immune response to a flu vaccine than the non-meditators.  The authors conclude that a short training program in mindfulness meditation has demonstrable effects on both brain and immune function."

## Background Information

Meditatative practices -- under what has become known as integrative medicine -- are becoming more commonly used in medical settings for outpatients presenting with things like chronic stress/disease and pain-related disorders.  The question of the biological mechanisms by which meditation can drive somatic, cognitive and emotional processes is only becoming more important.

Most studies up to this point have focused primarily on the changes "inside" of an individual meditation session, by comparing a meditator's state before and during meditation.  This study aims to put meditation in a wider work context by tracking changes when people are given an extended (8-week) training, and follows up with them in the months thereafter to begin to understand the more enduring changes that meditation can provide.

## What They Did

This study involved recruiting 48 right-handed employees from a biotechnology corporation in Madison, Wisconsin. These individuals were chosen to participate in a randomized controlled study to examine the effects of an 8-week {% include definition.html term="mindfulness" %}-Based Stress Reduction ({% include definition.html term="mbsr" %}) program applied in a work environment. Out of the initial participants, 41 completed some of the measures for at least two of the assessment points.

Before the start of the study, an initial laboratory evaluation was conducted for all participants without revealing their future group assignment. Following this preliminary assessment, subjects were randomly assigned to either the meditation group, consisting of 25 participants (19 females), or a wait-list control group, consisting of 16 participants (10 females). This assignment was done at a ratio of approximately 3:2.

Participants underwent a series of assessments at three different time points: before the start of the MBSR program (Time 1), immediately after the program (Time 2), and four months after the program (Time 3).  At eaxch time, the participants underwent an {% include definition.html term="eeg" %} scan while being presented with emotional stimuli.

Additionally, all participants received a flu vaccine at the Time 2, and the authors measured the immune response to the vaccine from blood antibody levels.

Upon completion of the last assessment, participants in the wait-list control group were offered the same 8-week MBSR training provided to the meditation group, ensuring that all participants eventually had the opportunity to receive the intervention. This approach not only facilitated the ethical conduct of the study by offering all participants access to the potentially beneficial meditation training but also allowed for a controlled comparison between those who had immediately undergone the MBSR program and those who were initially placed on a wait list.

## One Big Result

The first major finding of this study was that the 8-week MBSR course let to measurable changes in brain function when the subjects were presented with emotional stimuli.  One brain measurement that has been associated with positive emotions is asymmetry of brain activation.  From [a recent review of the literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111451/):

> Formation and regulation of happiness and positive emotions are associated with significant reductions in activity in the right prefrontal cortex [...], as well as with increased activity in the left prefrontal regions

The authors measured this asymmetry by taking the difference in the amount of activity in the right and left hemispheres in the brain, as shown in this figure:

![Bar graph showing changes in brain activation asymmetry between meditation and control groups. The y-axis shows the difference in activity between left and right hemispheres (with higher values indicating greater left-sided activation associated with positive emotions). The x-axis compares measurements at Time 1 (pre-intervention) and Time 3 (four months after intervention). Before the meditation course, both groups show similar levels of asymmetry. After the course, the meditation group (dark bars) shows significantly increased left-sided activation compared to the control group (light bars), indicating a shift toward brain activity patterns associated with positive emotional states. Error bars show standard error, and asterisks indicate statistical significance.](/assets/article_images/brain-and-immune-function/brain_asymmetry.png)

Furthermore, the authors looked at the immune response of the subjects to a flu vaccine, as depicted here:

![Bar graph comparing antibody response to influenza vaccine between meditation and control groups. The y-axis shows antibody titers (concentration of antibodies in blood) after vaccination. The meditation group (dark bar) shows a significantly higher antibody response compared to the control group (light bar), indicating enhanced immune function following the 8-week mindfulness meditation program. Error bars indicate standard error, and the asterisk denotes statistical significance (p<0.05), demonstrating that meditation practice measurably improved immune response to vaccination.](/assets/article_images/brain-and-immune-function/flu_vaccine_response.png)

The authors note that:

> To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a reliable effect of meditation on an in vivo measure of immune function. The finding may reflect a relatively more rapid peak rise in antibody titers among the meditators compared with the controls

This study is primarily observational, but the autors do note

> Recent studies have established that greater relative leftsided anterior activation at baseline is associated with enhanced immune function

And also point to other research on HIV-positive men, where relaxation and stress management procedures increased immune function:

> Recent research indicates that relaxation and stress management procedures increase T-cytotoxic/suppressor (CD3+CD) lymphocytes in HIV-infected me

Further evidence that the driving factor is meditation comes from this chart, which shows the correlation between the brain activiation asymmetries and the flu vaccine response:

![Scatter plot showing the correlation between brain activity and immune response for both meditation and control groups. The x-axis represents brain activation asymmetry (left minus right hemisphere activity), while the y-axis shows antibody response to influenza vaccine. The meditation group (solid circles with solid regression line) demonstrates a significant positive correlation (r=0.51, p<0.05), meaning participants with greater left-sided brain activation showed stronger immune responses. The control group (open circles with dashed regression line) shows no significant correlation (r=0.1). This graph provides evidence that the meditation-induced changes in brain activity are functionally related to improved immune function, suggesting a potential neurobiological mechanism for meditation's health benefits.](/assets/article_images/brain-and-immune-function/final_result.png)

Overall the authors take these findings to mean that:

> a short training program in mindfulness meditation (MBSR) has demonstrable effects on brain and immune function and underscores the need for additional research on the biological consequences of this intervention

I, personally, find this result to be very exciting.  First, this study was performed on untrained meditators with only an 8-week course in meditation. Indicating that meditation benefits are available to all, not just those who dedicate their lives to it.  Second, the study shows that meditation can have a measurable effects in the physiological world (in this case, the immune system), and that its impacts can be felt outside of the brain.

## Miscellaneous Interesting Takeaways

### It Doesn't Take Much

In other papers I reviewed on this site, subjects who were experienced meditators (to the tune of tens of thousands of hours), had striking differences in their brain activity compared to non-meditators for both meditations leading to {% include definition.html term="jhana" %} ([Hagerty et al. 2013](/ecstatic-meditation-reward-system)) and  meditation on the {% include definition.html term="brahmaviharas" %} ([Lutz et al. 2004](/high-amplitude-gamma-synchrony)) meditations.

This study, however, found that even a short training program in mindfulness meditation (MBSR) has demonstrable effects on brain and immune function.  This suggests that the benefits of meditation are accessible to everyone, not just those who have dedicated their lives to the practice.

### Happiness Is Trainable

This paper is part of a growing body of studies that indicate the brain is trainable, and that tendency towards positive emotions is a trainable skill.  This is a hopeful message for those who struggle with negative emotions.
