snippet: "Expert meditators experience less unpleasantness from pain than novices, despite similar intensity ratings. This difference is linked to enhanced activity in the brain's salience network during pain, suggesting that meditation can modify the emotional response to pain and facilitate quicker habituation to repeated pain stimuli."

## Background Information

It is well known that the mind regulates our perceptions of pain.  There are many mental strategies that can be used to reduce the perception of pain.  For example, distraction (for example, listening to music), or techniques that calter the context of the experience (hypnosis, cognitive reappraisal, or even a placebo).

Further research indicates that meditation can also reduce the perception of pain through acceptance and mindfulness.  Instead of striving to distract, ignore or reframe, meditation instead cultivates states of open acceptance and non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.  This is thought to reduce the perception of pain by reducing the emotional reaction to it.

Techniques such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ({% include definition.html term="mbsr" %}) and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) have been shown to decrease pain unpleasantness and lead to a reduction of symptoms in chronic pain patients.

This study aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of open awareness meditation on pain perception, focusing on the amygdala and the so-called "salience network", a set of regions in the brain thought to be responsible for detection and integration of emotional and sensory stimuli, as well as in modulating the switch between the internally directed cognition of the default mode network ({% include definition.html term="dmn" %}) and externally directed cognition.

## What They Did

The researchers compared the neural mechanisms of pain perception between expert meditators and novice participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study group consisted of 14 long-term Buddhist practitioners, each with over 10,000 hours of meditation experience, and 14 control subjects who had no prior experience with meditation. The central focus was on the effects of Open Presence (OP) meditation, a practice aimed at cultivating a state of acceptance and openness, on the participants' experience of pain. Participants were exposed to both painful and non-painful thermal stimuli while undergoing {% include definition.html term="fmri" %} scans, allowing the researchers to observe the brain's response to pain and meditation in real time.

The diagram presents a horizontal timeline beginning with a 45-second meditation period (labeled "Open Presence"), followed by anticipation phase starting at 0 seconds when the thermal device begins warming. At 12 seconds, the device reaches painful temperature (indicated by a red bar) lasting for 10 seconds until 22 seconds. After the pain stimulus ends, participants provide intensity ratings at 32 seconds and unpleasantness ratings at 37 seconds. Different colors indicate the meditation period, anticipation phase, pain stimulus, and rating periods, clearly illustrating the temporal sequence of events in each experimental trial.](/assets/article_images/activation-during-anticipation-pain/trial.png)

The experimental design included a detailed calibration process to determine the temperature threshold for pain stimuli for each participant, ensuring a consistent pain experience across the study. Participants received comprehensive instructions on the meditation practices to be employed during the experiment, with control subjects being given a brief training period to familiarize themselves with the meditation technique. The researchers analyzed the data to assess differences in pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings between the two groups, along with examining the brain's activity in response to pain. Key areas of investigation included the effect of meditation on anticipatory neural activity related to pain, the correlation between such activity and pain perception, and how meditation practice influences baseline brain activity and neural habituation to pain stimuli. This approach allowed for a nuanced understanding of how meditation impacts the neural processing of pain and the potential benefits of mindfulness practices in pain management.

## One Big Result

To summarize this paper down into one oversimplified takeaway:

> Compared to novices, expert meditators reported less unpleasantness during
pain.

What does this mean?  Here are the intensity and unpleasantness ratings for both groups

![Bar graph comparing intensity and unpleasantness ratings between expert meditators and novices during painful stimulation. The left side shows pain intensity ratings (0-10 scale) with nearly identical values between groups (approximately 7/10 for both). The right side shows unpleasantness ratings where expert meditators reported significantly lower values (approximately 3/10) compared to novices (approximately 5/10). Error bars show standard error, and an asterisk indicates statistical significance (p<0.05) for the unpleasantness difference but not for intensity. This clearly demonstrates that while both groups perceived similar pain intensity, experienced meditators found the pain substantially less unpleasant.](/assets/article_images/activation-during-anticipation-pain/intensity_unpleasantness.png)

This is an extremely clear finding:  Meditation decreases the perceived unpleasantness of pain.  The meditators also showed enhanced activity in the salience network during the painful event, indicating that they were more aware of the pain, but less emotionally reactive to it.

As an additional finding, the pain trials were repeated on each user a number of times, and the meditators underwent more rapid habituation to the pain stimuli than the novices.  That is: Even after an experience had been demonstrated safe by repeated exposure, the novices would continue to show the same anxiety response to it, while the meditation group would habituate to the experience and show less anxiety.

The attentional mechanisms observed here may relate to [Shields et al.'s (2020)]({% post_url 2025-03-13-deconstructing-concentration-interference-control %}) findings on meditation's effects on controlled attention processes, suggesting enhanced attentional control may contribute to altered pain perception. Given [Davidson, Kabat-Zinn et al.'s (2003)]({% post_url 2024-03-09-brain-and-immune-function %}) findings on meditation's effects on brain activity and immune function, future research might explore whether pain perception changes correlate with broader biological markers of health.

## Miscellaneous Interesting Takeaways

### Anticipation and the Two Arrows

There is a teaching in buddhism that has stuck with me ever since I first heard it, the story of the two arrows. According to this teaching, the Buddha described that when we are struck by an arrow, it is painful. This arrow represents whatever initial suffering or pain that we experience from life's inevitable challenges, such as illness, loss, or disappointment.

However, we often compound our suffering by the way we react to the first arrow. This reaction is likened to being struck by a second arrow. While the first arrow's pain is unavoidable, the second arrow represents the additional suffering we create for ourselves through our reactions, such as anger, frustration, self-pity, or resentment. Unlike the first arrow, the pain from the second arrow is not inevitable; it arises from our attachment, aversion, and ignorance.

Anxiety about pain that we know is safe is pretty much the definition of a second arrow.  The authors tested a hypothesis related to the two arrows:

>  Our second hypothesis was that experts would display less anxiety-related anticipatory activity in the amygdala and salience network prior to pain
compared to novices, as a result of the present-centered nature of this state

The following image shows the brain activity of the two groups during the anticipation of pain.

![Line graph showing brain activity (BOLD signal) in the anterior insula region across time during pain anticipation and experience. The x-axis shows time in seconds, with the pain stimulus occurring between 12-22 seconds (shaded area). Four lines represent different conditions: red/yellow for expert meditators and blue/green for novices, with solid and dashed lines distinguishing between high and low pain conditions. The graph reveals that novices (blue/green) show significantly higher activation in anticipation of pain (before 12 seconds) compared to meditators (red/yellow). During the actual pain (12-22 seconds), both groups show increased activity, but with different patterns. After pain offset, novices maintain higher activation than meditators. This demonstrates meditators' reduced anticipatory anxiety and different neural processing of pain.](/assets/article_images/activation-during-anticipation-pain/anxiety.png)

The main takeaway from this image is that the novices demonstrate much higher salience network activation than the meditators before the painful event.  Also notably, the degree of brain activation in the novices is pretty much the same whether or not the painful event even happens.  By the time that the painful event actually occurs, the novices are already in a state of high anxiety, while the meditators are not.
