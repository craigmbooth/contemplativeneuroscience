    <p>
      This site collects accessible summaries of peer-reviewed research at the intersection of meditation and brain science. As a meditation practitioner and scientist, I'm fascinated by how contemplative practices shape cognition, emotion, and identity. My aim is to make this research understandable and meaningful to others who share this curiosityâ€”whether you're a fellow practitioner, a researcher, or just meditation-curious.
