theme_description: |
  While meditation is often portrayed as universally beneficial, a growing body of research acknowledges that contemplative practices can sometimes lead to challenging or adverse effects in certain individuals or contexts. These range from transient psychological discomfort to more severe and lasting difficulties.

  This theme examines research on meditation-related challenges, including experiences like meditation-induced anxiety, depersonalization/derealization unrelated to progress, exacerbation of trauma symptoms, and other potentially difficult outcomes that practitioners may encounter. Understanding these effects is crucial for developing safer implementation of contemplative practices across clinical and non-clinical settings.
