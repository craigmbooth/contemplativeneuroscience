theme_description: |
  What happens in the brain during meditation? This theme collects studies that use neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques to map how contemplative states modulate neural activity. From changes in activation during pain, to shifts in attention-related networks and salience processing, these findings highlight the diverse ways meditation reshapes brain function. Importantly, the observed changes are often specific to the kind of meditative practice used—whether focused attention, open presence, or compassion training—suggesting that different intentions may sculpt the brain in different ways. This research offers a window into the elusive terrain of inner experience by grounding it in measurable neural signatures.
