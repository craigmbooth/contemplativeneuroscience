theme_description: |
  Meditation has long been linked to better rest, but how exactly does it affect the sleeping brain and body? This theme brings together studies exploring how contemplative practice influences sleep quality, architecture, and related physiological processes. From improving subjective sleep satisfaction to altering inflammatory markers and cognitive control mechanisms, these findings show how meditation might help us fall asleep faster, sleep more deeply, and wake more refreshed. They also hint at something deeper: that our waking practices shape our sleeping mind.
