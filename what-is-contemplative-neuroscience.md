Contemplative neuroscience is a multidisciplinary field that integrates methods and theories from neuroscience with the practices and principles of contemplative traditions, such as meditation and mindfulness, to investigate the effects of these practices on the brain and mind. This field examines how contemplative practices influence cognitive, emotional, and neural processes. Contemplative neuroscience draws from a broad range of fields to build its interdisciplinary approach. The primary fields include:

* **Psychology**: Understands mental processes and behaviors influenced by contemplative practices.
* **Psychiatry**: Applies contemplative practices in therapeutic contexts for mental health conditions.
* **Neurology**: Examines changes in the brain's structure and function resulting from contemplative practices.
* **Cognitive Neuroscience**: Investigates the neural mechanisms underpinning mental processes affected by contemplative practices.
* **The Study and Practice of Contemplative Traditions**: Integrates the knowledge, techniques, and philosophical underpinnings of various contemplative practices (such as meditation, mindfulness, and prayer) from different cultural and religious traditions, directly informing the theoretical and practical approaches within contemplative neuroscience.

Beyond these core disciplines, contemplative neuroscience also integrates knowledge from:

* **Behavioral Neuroscience**: Looks at the biological bases of behavior modified by contemplative practices.
* **Social Neuroscience**: Explores how contemplative practices influence social cognition and relationships.
* **Clinical Neuroscience**: Applies neuroscience to understand and treat mental disorders, including the use of contemplative practices in interventions.
* **Developmental Psychology**: Investigates the effects of contemplative practices across the lifespan.
* **Health Psychology**: Studies the impact of contemplative practices on psychological and physical health.
* **Neuroendocrinology**: Examines how contemplative practices affect the interactions between the nervous and endocrine systems.
* **Physiology**: Looks at the physiological changes brought about by contemplative practices.
* **Anthropology and Cultural Studies**: Provides insights into the cultural origins and meanings of contemplative practices, facilitating a cross-cultural understanding of their effects.

These disciplines collectively contribute to the comprehensive exploration of how contemplative practices affect the mind, brain, and body, enabling a deeper understanding of their potential benefits and mechanisms of action.
